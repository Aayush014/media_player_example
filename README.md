## Introduction

The Parallax Effect Flutter App demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect using Flutter's `PageView` and `AnimatedBuilder` widgets. The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by making background images move slower than foreground images.

## Features

- Smooth parallax scrolling effect.
- Customizable card data.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Easy to integrate into existing Flutter projects.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aayush014/media_player_example.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

To use the `SlidingCardsView` widget in your own Flutter projects, follow these steps:

1. **Import the necessary files:**

    Copy the `SlidingCardsView` implementation files from this project to your own project.

2. **Integrate the parallax effect:**

    Use the `SlidingCardsView` widget in your layout and customize the card data and parallax settings to fit your design requirements.

## Parallax Effect Explanation

The parallax effect is a visual phenomenon that creates an illusion of depth by moving background images slower than the foreground images when scrolling. This effect mimics how objects closer to the viewer appear to move faster than objects further away, providing a sense of three-dimensional depth in a two-dimensional space.

In the context of this Flutter app, the parallax effect is achieved using a combination of `PageView`, `PageController`, and `AnimatedBuilder`. The `PageView` widget allows for horizontal scrolling of a list of cards. The `PageController` keeps track of the current scroll position. `AnimatedBuilder` listens for changes in the `PageController`'s scroll position and triggers a rebuild of the widget with the new position.

By applying a translation transformation to the card images based on the current scroll position, we can create the parallax effect. Specifically, the translation is calculated using an exponential function of the scroll offset, ensuring that images move at different speeds relative to their positions, thereby creating a layered movement effect. This results in a visually appealing and dynamic user interface that enhances the user experience by adding depth and immersion.
